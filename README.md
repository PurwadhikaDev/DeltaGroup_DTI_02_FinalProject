# Telco Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Overview
Telecommunication companies face challenges in retaining their subscribed customers. In this project, we build a Machine Learning model to predict customer churn based on demographic data, customer account information, and service usage.
According to Harvard Business Review, acquiring a new customer can be 10-25 times more expensive than retaining an existing one. Therefore, this project aims to reduce churn rates through a data-driven strategy.
